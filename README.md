# Lotka Volterra Model and its Stochastic Variants

This repo contains the project files for the course "Stochastic Processes and Simulations in Natural Sciences" at Bocconi University. Contributions by Edoardo Ghirardo, Francois Hoche and Elisa Tofanelli.

Our project consists in simulating the Lotka Volterra model and its stochastic variants. The `code` folder contains `lotka_volterra_models_comparison.ipynb`, the notebook with the explanation of the models and the simulations, and a `simulations` folder with the pickled simulation results. `SLV-env.yml` is the environment file for the conda environment used to run the notebook.

Thank you for your attention!
