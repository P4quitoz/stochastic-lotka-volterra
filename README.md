# Lotka Volterra Model and its Stochastic Variants

This repo contains the project files for the course "Stochastic Processes and Simulations in Natural Sciences" at Bocconi University. Contributions by Edoardo Ghirardo, Francois Hoche and Elisa Tofanelli.

Our project consists in simulating the Lotka Volterra model and its stochastic variants. The `code` folder contains `lotka_volterra_models_comparison.ipynb`, the notebook with the explanation of the models and the simulations, and a `simulations` folder with the pickled simulation results.

## How to visualize and run the code

To visualize the code with the interactive plots, you will can either use click the button below to run the `lotka_volterra_models_comparison.ipynb` notebook in your browser (recommended) or clone the repository and run the notebook locally (in an environment which has the libraries specified in `requirements.txt`)

Alternatively, you can view the `lotka_volterra_models_comparison_static_plots.ipynb` notebook directly from github. This notebook contains the same code as `lotka_volterra_models_comparison.ipynb`, but it does not include the (nice) interactive plots.

Thank you for your attention!
