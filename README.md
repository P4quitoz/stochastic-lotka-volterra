# Lotka Volterra Model and its Stochastic Variants

This repo contains the project files for the course "Stochastic Processes and Simulations in Natural Sciences" at Bocconi University. Contributions by Edoardo Ghirardo, Francois Hoche and Elisa Tofanelli.

Our project consists in simulating the Lotka Volterra model and its stochastic variants. The `code` folder contains `lotka_volterra_models_comparison.ipynb`, the notebook with the explanation of the models and the simulations (as well as a version with static plots for quick viewing), and a `simulations` folder with the pickled simulation results. `SLV-env.yml` is the environment file for the conda environment used to run the notebook.

## How to visualize and run the code

To visualize the code with the interactive plots, you will can either use binder to run the `lotka_volterra_models_comparison.ipynb` notebook in your browser (recommended) or clone the repository and run the notebook locally.

Alternatively, you can view the `lotka_volterra_models_comparison_static_plots.ipynb` notebook directly from github. This notebook contains the same code as `lotka_volterra_models_comparison.ipynb`, but it does not include the (nice) interactive plots.
